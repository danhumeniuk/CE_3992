With the increasing number of drivers, road safety
is becoming a great concern. To reduce safety risks, car makers
have begun to include various technologies such as sensors to
assist drivers in parking, emergency breaking, adaptive cruise
control, etc. Even with these technologies, a driver cannot know
what the intentions of surrounding vehicles are. Communication
between vehicles locally and via the internet are key components
to creating fully autonomous cars. Sharing information
simultaneously between moving vehicles and the internet is
difficult. This paper discusses methods of creating a network,
known as the Internet of Vehicles, to efficiently communicate
with other vehicles. This paper also discusses few challenges
encountered in implementing such a network. In addition to
challenges, results from recent advancements in this filed are
discussed. With this network implemented, transportation via
cars will become safer and faster.

\section{Introduction}
\lettrine{T}{he} Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming prominent as the
number of devices that are capable of connecting to the
internet increases. The idea of IoT comes from smart devices
connected to the Internet that communicate with each other
with minimum human input. An excellent example of IoT is a
house where devices such as smart thermostat and security
cameras are installed. A smart thermostat could be set up to
turn on an air conditioner to desired settings when a person is
near their house. The smart thermostat knows the person’s
location via their smartphone, which now a day almost
everyone keeps on them. This set up will keep functioning
long as the smartphone and the smart thermostat are connected
to internet. With a smart thermostat, the house temperature
will be set to a user’s comfortable setting long before the user
has entered the house. Similarly, a security camera that is
connected to the internet can be set up to notify a person via
their smartphone if it detects any movement. The nonfictions
can be very helpful because it informs a person of any
suspicious activity happening inside or outside of their house.
With this information, the person can take proper precaution.
Both the smart thermostat and the security camera are
designed to ultimately make a person’s day to day life easier.

The Internet of Things is not just a house with smart devices
installed. It can be applied to many things. Fig. 1 above shows
an illustration of devices that are used regularly in our day to
day life. While Fig. 2 shows how IoT can be broken apart into
smaller sub categories.

Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is derived from the Internet of
Things concept. In the IoV model, autonomous vehicles will
be communicating with each other via the Internet, like the
way devices communicate in IoT. However, IoV is more
complex and difficult to implement. Since there will be very
minimum user input, the autonomous vehicles must efficiently
communicate with each other to maintain a steady traffic flow.
The interesting aspect of vehicular network is that vehicles3
will be sharing valuable information. In the case of an
accident, the first vehicle to encounter the scene will share the
information it collected with nearby vehicles. With this
information being spread out, vehicles can navigate to an
alternate path and keeping the traffic jam to minimum. This
information can also indicate vehicles near the accident to
clear a path for any law enforcement vehicles, ambulances and
fire trucks [1].

To create a massive network of IoV, communication
between vehicles is very important. There are many challenges
that currently face IoV. However, this paper focuses on couple
of communication challenges. One, autonomous vehicles must
be equipped with sufficient sensors and communication
devices. Two, the vehicular network needs to efficiently
manage and share information between vehicles. The IoV
combined with autonomous vehicle will lead to safer, faster,
and more comfortable vehicle transportation.

\section{Materials and Methods}
Artificial Intelligence can be used for many components that make up an autonomous car. However, since there are a lot of components, this paper focuses on summarizing path planning and vehicle detection. 


\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the feature of Artificial Intelligence in autonomous cars seems promising. Each component in the cars will have use of AI. Path planning and vehicle detection are only couple of the component that already use AI. However, they are not perfect and are being constantly improved. AI for autonomous cars is an important area to research because its market is growing. Ultimately, fully autonomous cars will make everyone’s day to day life easier and safer.
